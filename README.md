# Yelp Star Predictor

This project predicts Yelp review star ratings using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It includes exploratory data analysis, feature extraction using TF-IDF, classification via logistic regression, and LSTM-based deep learning models. Visualizations such as heatmaps and geographic plots help illustrate patterns in review content and sentiment.

## Features

- Preprocessing of text data (stopword removal, tokenization, lemmatization)
- TF-IDF and CountVectorizer vectorization
- Logistic Regression classification
- LSTM-based neural network modeling using Keras/TensorFlow
- Geospatial data analysis and visualization using `folium` and `geopandas`
